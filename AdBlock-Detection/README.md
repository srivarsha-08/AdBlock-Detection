How It Works
	1.	JavaScript dynamically adds commonly blocked ad-related class names to a hidden div.
	2.	If an AdBlocker is active, the element is hidden (display: none).
	3.	The script detects this and shows a popup asking users to whitelist the site.
	4.	Users can dismiss the popup using a button.

⸻

How to Run
	1.	Download or clone the repository
	2.	Open index.html in any modern browser
	3.	Enable/disable AdBlocker to test the detection

No server or setup required.
